for import (from git repo to eclipse) you should rename first one name which was available in eclipse because new one will come at same name
from repo.
git checkout b (branch name) //can make new branch and switch to that branch
git pull origin or path of repo then branch name which branch you want to send
git push -u origin branch name which branch you want to send.
