Tell me about yourself version 2
==========================
Change it as per your skills.

   i have been working as a qa engineer since 5+ years.
Throughout my career I worked as a manual and automation tester for web based and mobile
based application where I mostly performed front end and back end testing
To do that I mostly worked in Agile methodology in both scrum and Kanban project
As a tester my main responsibility is to find the bug and raise into bug tracking tools like jira and
rally
    As a tester I analyzed acceptance criteria, business requirements, test strategies, test plans and
wrote test cases into test rail and excel sheet and execute them manually and using automation
tool like selenium web driver api in different server/environment like qa, prepod and production
As a QA i’ve experience writing different kind of documentation and attend different agile
meeting with on shore and off shore team
As a automation engineer i mostly used selenium web driver api for funtional/ui testing for web
based applications
to enhance my selenium scripts i used oop concept like java
even though i have good knowledge in python in c# but i never got chance to implement using
selenium
in my career i have chance to work in different framework like hybrid data driven, add cucumber
etc where i mostly used maven as a project building tool
to maintain my test cases i used testng as a testing framework
to share our project within team members i get chance to work in different version control tool
like git and bigbucket
to run our regression suite nightly bases we trigger our project into jenkins
sometimes i performed parallel and crossbrowing testing using selenium grid and sauce lab
for reporting purpose i used log4j, ireporter extend report and customized html report
so i have a good exposure in bed cucumber framework where i mostly write feature file using
gherkin syntax and implement them using page object model concept through step definition
class
even though i m expert for ui testing but i have a hands on experience for back end testing as
well
to validate my data base i wrote some simple and complex queries using mysql and oracle
so i have sound knowledge in api testing like rest and soap using postman and soapui tools
manually
beside that i execute rest api using automation tool like jackson and rest assured framework
on the other hand i get chance to work in mobile application using automation tool like appium
for web and native app
so even though i have experience for web and hybrid app i execute mobile scripts using real
devices and simulator and emulator for both platform iOS and android
beside all of my automation experience i have a sound knowledge about web fundamentals
concepts like html, css, javascript, ajax, angular js etc
in short thats all about myself, if u have any further question i’ll be happy to elaborate more
